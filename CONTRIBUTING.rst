Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `citeproc-py` for local development.

1. Fork the `citeproc-py` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/citeproc-py.git
      $ cd citeproc-py
      $ git submodule update --init

3. Create a branch for local development:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

4. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass tests:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ cd tests
      $ python citeproc-test.py

   This command will list and fixed or newly failing tests. You should
   fix any failures, and commit the ``failing_tests.txt`` file with any
   updates.

5. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ git add .
      $ git commit -s -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
      $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

5. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should not break existing tests. 
2. If you're fixing something or adding a new feature please add test 
   cases so we can see what has been fixed or improved and make sure 
   it doesn't break in the future.

All pull requests need at least one review before they can be merged.
